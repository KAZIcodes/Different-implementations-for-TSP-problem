# Different-implementations-for-TSP-problem
This repository contains implementation of Brute Force, Dynamic Programming and MST Based(Christofides) solutions of TSP problem along side the implementation of my greedy algorithm for it.

## Description of my algorithm
It provides a greedy heuristic-based approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The algorithm calculates the TSP route by considering not only the direct edge weight but also the minimum edge weights of the next two levels of connected nodes, aiming for a more informed greedy choice at each step.
